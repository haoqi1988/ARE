Description: This package is a direct application of the ARE model proposed by Nickel, Jiang and Tresp, 2014. The package has a function that factorizes a multilayer network (tensor) into the Additive Relational Effects of attributes and indirect Links. This package can be used for relational machine learning and rank reduction on multiplex networks and knowledge graphs.
